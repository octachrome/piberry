The basics
==========

A great introduction to Raspberry Pi baremetal programming can be found in [David Welch's Github project](https://github.com/dwelch67/raspberrypi). I won't repeat it here.

Essential reference material:

- [BCM2835 data sheet](http://www.raspberrypi.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/BCM2835-ARM-Peripherals.pdf).
- [ARM Architecture Reference Manual](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/~waldroj/3d1/arm_arm.pdf) (or Google "ARM DDI 0100i").

The BCM2835 is based on an ARM1176JZ-F processor, part of the ARM11 processor family, which implements the ARMv6 instruction set architecture. This is a bit confusing, but useful for figuring out what features/instructions are supported.

I hope to add more documents to this directory as I learn more about how to use the BCM2835.
